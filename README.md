# Integration Homework

This repo contains a code scaffold for the integration homework. It will contain the solution to the questions on a branch `solution` in due course.

## Outline

* You see here the typical julia package setup with `src` and `test` folder. 
	* Inside `src` I set up a module for you, with some empty function definitions that you should fill out. 
	* Inside `test` I set up a test module, where you should place your unit tests. You will get extra points for unit tests.
* You don't have to stick the scaffold I give you, but you have to provide a function `runall` that runs all of your questions. This function is currently provided.
* your answer to each question should be a function.
* each question should print the desired result to screen, e.g. using the `println` function.
* if you are not able to solve a question, the last statement of the function should be `println("I could not solve this question")`.

## Questions

* Given that there was some math notation necessary, I give you the questions as an `IJulia` notebook in this repository. It's called `questions.ipynb`.
* If you click on that file above, github will render this nicely for you.
* There is an analytic part to the question. You should edit the `questions.ipynb` notebook and include that in your submission. Instructions for doing this are contained within. I'm not interested in your solution per se, but you need it as an input to the rest of the questions. (If you can't figure out how to edit that notebook at all [google "latex in ipython notebook"], bring a piece of paper. If you don't know Latex, bring a piece of paper.)

##Â Submission

* Deadline is 24h prior to our next class.
* You must submit your work via pull request.  

1. Fork this repository (click on **fork** top right of this page; this makes a copy of this repo on your github account [*somewhere in the cloud*])
1. Go to your fork (it takes you there anyway), and clone your fork to your computer (click on **clone or download**)
	1. If you installed Github Desktop (recommended), click on "Open in Desktop"
	1. GitHub Desktop will ask you where you want the repo cloned to. Let's call that location on your computer `x`.
	1. Navigate to location `x`.
	1. Do the homework.
1. Back in Github Desktop: You see it says *1 uncommitted change*. It tells you that the state of the repo changed. good.
1. write a summary of the change. 
1. click on *commit to master*. `master` is the default branch on this repo.
1. Top right in Github Desktop, click on *Pull Request*.
1. In the comment, let me know who was working together on this homework. You should mention yourself and your collaborator's name with `@your_github_username`. For example, I would write "this was done by @floswald".
1. Then click *Send Pull Request*.
1. Done.
